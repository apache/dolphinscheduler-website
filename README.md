# Apache DolphinScheduler Official Website

This project keeps all sources used for building up DolphinScheduler official website which is served at https://dolphinscheduler.apache.org/.

## Prerequisite

DolphinScheduler website is powered by [docsite](https://github.com/chengshiwen/docsite-ext).

Please also make sure your node version is 10+, version lower than 10.x is not supported yet.

## Build instruction 

1. Run `npm install` in the root directory to install the dependencies.
2. Run `npm run start` in the root directory to start a local server, you will see the website in 'http://127.0.0.1:8080'.
3. Run `npm run build` to build source code into dist directory.
4. Verify your change locally: `python -m SimpleHTTPServer 8000`, when your python version is 3 use :`python3 -m http.server 8000` instead.

If you have higher version of node installed, you may consider `nvm` to allow different versions of `node` coexisting on your machine.

1. Follow the [instructions](http://nvm.sh) to install nvm
2. Run `nvm install v10.23.1` to install node v10
3. Run `nvm use v10.23.1` to switch the working environment to node v10

Then you are all set to run and build the website. Follow the build instruction above for the details.
