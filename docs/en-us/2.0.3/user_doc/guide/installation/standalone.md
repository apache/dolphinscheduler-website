# Standalone

Standalone only for quick look for DolphinScheduler.

If you are a green hand and want to experience DolphinScheduler, we recommended you install follow [Standalone](standalone.md). If you want to experience more complete functions or schedule large tasks number, we recommended you install follow [pseudo-cluster deployment](pseudo-cluster.md). If you want to using DolphinScheduler in production, we recommended you follow [cluster deployment](cluster.md) or [kubernetes](kubernetes.md)

> **_Note:_** Standalone only recommends the use of less than 20 workflows, because it uses H2 Database, ZooKeeper Testing Server, too many tasks may cause instability
