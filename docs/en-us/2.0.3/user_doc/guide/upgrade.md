# DolphinScheduler Upgrade Documentation

## Back Up Previous Version's Files and Database

## Stop All Services of DolphinScheduler

 `sh ./script/stop-all.sh`

## Download the New Version's Installation Package

- [Download](/en-us/download/download.html) the latest version of the installation packages.
- The following upgrade operations need to be performed in the new version's directory.

## Database Upgrade
- Modify the following properties in `conf/config/install_config.conf`.

- If you use MySQL as the database to run DolphinScheduler, please comment out PostgreSQL related configurations, and add mysql connector jar into lib dir, here we download mysql-connector-java-8.0.16.jar, and then correctly config database connect information. You can download mysql connector jar [here](https://downloads.MySQL.com/archives/c-j/). Alternatively, if you use Postgres as database, you just need to comment out Mysql related configurations, and correctly config database connect information.

```conf
# Database type, username, password, IP, port, metadata. For now dbtype supports `mysql` and `postgresql`, `H2`
# Please make sure that the value of configuration is quoted in double quotation marks, otherwise may not take effect
DATABASE_TYPE="mysql"
SPRING_DATASOURCE_URL="jdbc:mysql://ds1:3306/ds_201_doc?useUnicode=true&characterEncoding=UTF-8"
# Have to modify if you are not using dolphinscheduler/dolphinscheduler as your username and password
SPRING_DATASOURCE_USERNAME="dolphinscheduler"
SPRING_DATASOURCE_PASSWORD="dolphinscheduler"
```

- Execute database upgrade script

    `sh ./script/create-dolphinscheduler.sh`

## Backend Service Upgrade

### Modify the Content in `conf/config/install_config.conf` File
- Standalone Deployment please refer the [6, Modify running arguments] in [Standalone-Deployment](./installation/standalone.md).
- Cluster Deployment please refer the [6, Modify running arguments] in [Cluster-Deployment](./installation/cluster.md).

#### Masters Need Attentions

1„ÄÅModify the workers config item in conf/config/install_config.conf file.

Imaging bellow are the machine worker service to be deployed:
| hostname | ip |
| :---  | :---:  |
| ds1   | 192.168.xx.10     |
| ds2   | 192.168.xx.11     |
| ds3   | 192.168.xx.12     |

To keep worker group config consistent with the previous version, we need to modify workers config item as below:

```shell
#worker service is deployed on which machine, and also specify which worker group this worker belongs to. 
workers="ds1:service1,ds2:service2,ds3:service2"
```

### Execute Deploy Script
```shell
`sh install.sh`
```
