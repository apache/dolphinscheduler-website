  <span id=runParamers>Description of workflow operating parameters:</span> 
       
      * Failure strategy: When a task node fails to execute, other parallel task nodes need to execute the strategy. "Continue" means: after a certain task fails, other task nodes execute normally; "End" means: terminate all tasks being executed, and terminate the entire process.
      * Notification strategy: When the process is over, the process execution information notification email is sent according to the process status, including any status is not sent, successful sent, failed sent, successful or failed sent.
      * Process priority: The priority of process operation, divided into five levels: highest (HIGHEST), high (HIGH), medium (MEDIUM), low (LOW), and lowest (LOWEST). When the number of master threads is insufficient, high-level processes will be executed first in the execution queue, and processes with the same priority will be executed in a first-in first-out order.
      * Worker group: The process can only be executed in the specified worker machine group. The default is Default, which can be executed on any worker.
      * Notification group: select notification strategy||timeout alarm||when fault tolerance occurs, process information or email will be sent to all members in the notification group.
      * Recipient: Select notification policy||Timeout alarm||When fault tolerance occurs, process information or alarm email will be sent to the recipient list.
      * Cc: Select the notification strategy||Timeout alarm||When fault tolerance occurs, the process information or warning email will be copied to the CC list.
      * Complement: Two modes including serial complement and parallel complement. Serial complement: within the specified time range, the complement is executed sequentially from the start date to the end date, and only one process instance is generated; parallel complement: within the specified time range, multiple days are complemented at the same time to generate N process instances.
    * For example, you need to fill in the data from May 1 to May 10.

    <p align="center">
        <img src="/img/complement_en1.png" width="80%" />
    </p>

  > Serial mode: The complement is executed sequentially from May 1 to May 10, and a process instance is generated on the process instance page;

### 3. Resource Center

#### 3.1 hdfs resource configuration

- Upload resource files and udf functions, all uploaded files and resources will be stored on hdfs, so the following configuration items are required:

```

conf/common/common.properties
    # Users who have permission to create directories under the HDFS root path
    hdfs.root.user=hdfs
    # data base dir, resource file will store to this hadoop hdfs path, self configuration, please make sure the directory exists on hdfs and have read write permissions。"/escheduler" is recommended
    data.store2hdfs.basepath=/dolphinscheduler
    # resource upload startup type : HDFS,S3,NONE
    res.upload.startup.type=HDFS
    # whether kerberos starts
    hadoop.security.authentication.startup.state=false
    # java.security.krb5.conf path
    java.security.krb5.conf.path=/opt/krb5.conf
    # loginUserFromKeytab user
    login.user.keytab.username=hdfs-mycluster@ESZ.COM
    # loginUserFromKeytab path
    login.user.keytab.path=/opt/hdfs.headless.keytab

conf/common/hadoop.properties
    # ha or single namenode,If namenode ha needs to copy core-site.xml and hdfs-site.xml
    # to the conf directory，support s3，for example : s3a://dolphinscheduler
    fs.defaultFS=hdfs://mycluster:8020
    #resourcemanager ha note this need ips , this empty if single
    yarn.resourcemanager.ha.rm.ids=192.168.xx.xx,192.168.xx.xx
    # If it is a single resourcemanager, you only need to configure one host name. If it is resourcemanager HA, the default configuration is fine
    yarn.application.status.address=http://xxxx:8088/ws/v1/cluster/apps/%s

```

- Only one address needs to be configured for yarn.resourcemanager.ha.rm.ids and yarn.application.status.address, and the other address is empty.
- You need to copy core-site.xml and hdfs-site.xml from the conf directory of the Hadoop cluster to the conf directory of the dolphinscheduler project, and restart the api-server service.

Token call example
    /**
     * test token
     */
    public  void doPOSTParam()throws Exception{
        // create HttpClient
        CloseableHttpClient httpclient = HttpClients.createDefault();

        // create http post request
        HttpPost httpPost = new HttpPost("http://127.0.0.1:12345/escheduler/projects/create");
        httpPost.setHeader("token", "123");
        // set parameters
        List<NameValuePair> parameters = new ArrayList<NameValuePair>();
        parameters.add(new BasicNameValuePair("projectName", "qzw"));
        parameters.add(new BasicNameValuePair("desc", "qzw"));
        UrlEncodedFormEntity formEntity = new UrlEncodedFormEntity(parameters);
        httpPost.setEntity(formEntity);
        CloseableHttpResponse response = null;
        try {
            // execute
            response = httpclient.execute(httpPost);
            // response status code 200
            if (response.getStatusLine().getStatusCode() == 200) {
                String content = EntityUtils.toString(response.getEntity(), "UTF-8");
                System.out.println(content);
            }
        } finally {
            if (response != null) {
                response.close();
            }
            httpclient.close();
        }
    }
```

#### 5.6 Granted permission

    * Granted permissions include project permissions, resource permissions, data source permissions, UDF function permissions.
    * The administrator can authorize the projects, resources, data sources and UDF functions not created by ordinary users. Because the authorization methods for projects, resources, data sources and UDF functions are the same, we take project authorization as an example.
    * Note: For projects created by users themselves, the user has all permissions. The project list and the selected project list will not be displayed.

- The administrator enters the Security Center -> User Management page and clicks the "Authorize" button of the user who needs to be authorized, as shown in the figure below:

#### 8. parameter

#### 8.1 System parameters

<table>
    <tr><th>variable</th><th>meaning</th></tr>
    <tr>
        <td>${system.biz.date}</td>
        <td>The day before the scheduled time of the daily scheduling instance, the format is yyyyMMdd, when the data is supplemented, the date is +1</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>${system.biz.curdate}</td>
        <td>The timing time of the daily scheduling instance, the format is yyyyMMdd, when the data is supplemented, the date is +1</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>${system.datetime}</td>
        <td>The timing time of the daily scheduling instance, the format is yyyyMMddHHmmss, when the data is supplemented, the date is +1</td>
    </tr>
</table>

#### 8.2 Time custom parameters

- Support custom variable names in the code, declaration method: \${variable name}. It can refer to "system parameters" or specify "constants".

- We define this benchmark variable as $[...] format, $[yyyyMMddHHmmss] can be decomposed and combined arbitrarily, such as: $[yyyyMMdd], $[HHmmss], \$[yyyy-MM-dd], etc.

- The following format can also be used:

      * Next N years：$[add_months(yyyyMMdd,12*N)]
      * N years before：$[add_months(yyyyMMdd,-12*N)]
      * Next N months：$[add_months(yyyyMMdd,N)]
      * N months before：$[add_months(yyyyMMdd,-N)]
      * Next N weeks：$[yyyyMMdd+7*N]
      * First N weeks：$[yyyyMMdd-7*N]
      * Next N days：$[yyyyMMdd+N]
      * N days before：$[yyyyMMdd-N]
      * Next N hours：$[HHmmss+N/24]
      * First N hours：$[HHmmss-N/24]
      * Next N minutes：$[HHmmss+N/24/60]
      * First N minutes：$[HHmmss-N/24/60]

#### 8.3 <span id=UserDefinedParameters>User-defined parameters</span>

- User-defined parameters are divided into global parameters and local parameters. Global parameters are global parameters passed when saving workflow definitions and workflow instances. Global parameters can be referenced in the local parameters of any task node in the entire process.
  example：

<p align="center">
   <img src="/img/local_parameter_en.png" width="80%" />
 </p>

- global_bizdate is a global parameter, which refers to a system parameter.

<p align="center">
   <img src="/img/global_parameter_en.png" width="80%" />
 </p>

- In the task, local_param_bizdate uses \${global_bizdate} to refer to global parameters. For scripts, you can use \${local_param_bizdate} to refer to the value of global variable global_bizdate, or directly set the value of local_param_bizdate through JDBC.
