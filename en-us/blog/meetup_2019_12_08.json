The Apache community already has more than 10 open source projects from our native China. This time, users and technology enthusiasts who joined the two Apache community projects gathered together to share open source technologies together for China's native open source contribution!</p>\n<p>Apache ShardingSphere (Incubator) is a set of open source distributed database middleware. It aims to fully and reasonably utilize the computing and storage capabilities of relational databases in distributed scenarios, and provides standardized data sharding, distributed transactions, and database governance. Functions can be applied to various diverse application scenarios such as Java isomorphism, heterogeneous languages, and cloud native.</p>\n<p>Apache DolphinScheduler (Incubator) is a distributed decentralized, easily scalable visual DAG workflow task scheduling system. Committed to solving the intricate dependencies in the data processing process, it has features such as high reliability (HA), easy expansion, support for most task scenarios, and ease of use (visual drag), and has been used by dozens of companies.</p>\n<p>The two communities are invited to use the theory and practice of partners and Committer to share experience and communicate on the spot. At the end of the event, there will be wonderful discussions on how to join the Apache community and become a Committer or PPMC. Contribute to open source together!</p>\n<p><strong>The agenda is as follows</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>14:00 - 14:40 The integration of DolphinScheduler and containerization (Xiaochun Liu) <a href=\"/file/2019-12-08/DolphinScheduler_liuxiaochun.pptx\">PPT</a></li>\n<li>14:40 - 15:20 Analyzing of Sharding-Proxy principle (Yonglun Zhang <a href=\"/file/2019-12-08/ShardingSphere_zhangyonglun.pptx\">PPT</a></li>\n<li>15:20 - 16:00 Migration and application of DolphinScheduler in Baiwang (Shuang Yang)<a href=\"/file/2019-12-08/DolphinScheduler_yangshuang.pptx\">PPT</a></li>\n<li>16:10 - 16:40 The Architecture of ShardingSphere and Roadmap (Juan Pan)  <a href=\"/file/2019-12-08/ShardingSphere_panjuan.pptx\">PPT</a></li>\n<li>16:40 - 17:20 Roundtable Discussion - How to join the Apache community and to be a committer</li>\n<li>Free discussion</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Wonderful moment</strong></p>\n<p><img src=\"/img/2019-12-08/951576036704_.pic_hd.jpg\" alt=\"avatar\"></p>\n<p><img src=\"/img/2019-12-08/961576036709_.pic_hd.jpg\" alt=\"avatar\"></p>\n<p><img src=\"/img/2019-12-08/971576036713_.pic_hd.jpg\" alt=\"avatar\"></p>\n<p><img src=\"/img/2019-12-08/981576036714_.pic.jpg\" alt=\"avatar\"></p>\n<p><img src=\"/img/2019-12-08/991576036717_.pic_hd.jpg\" alt=\"avatar\"></p>\n",
