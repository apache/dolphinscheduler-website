Workflow-as-code lets users create workflows through the Python API, which is great news for users who need to create and update workflows dynamically and in batches. Workflows created with Workflow-as-code can be viewed in the web UI just like other workflows.</p>\n<p>The following is a Workflow-as-code test case:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-py\"><span class=\"hljs-comment\"># Define workflow properties, including name, scheduling period, start time, tenant, etc.</span>\n\n<span class=\"hljs-keyword\">with</span> ProcessDefinition(\n    name=<span class=\"hljs-string\">&quot;tutorial&quot;</span>,\n    schedule=<span class=\"hljs-string\">&quot;0 0 0 * * ? *&quot;</span>,\n    start_time=<span class=\"hljs-string\">&quot;2021-01-01&quot;</span>,\n    tenant=<span class=\"hljs-string\">&quot;tenant_exists&quot;</span>,\n) <span class=\"hljs-keyword\">as</span> pd:\n    <span class=\"hljs-comment\"># Define 4 tasks, which are all shell tasks, the required parameters of shell tasks are task name, command information, here are all the shell commands of echo   </span>\n\n    task_parent = Shell(name=<span class=\"hljs-string\">&quot;task_parent&quot;</span>, command=<span class=\"hljs-string\">&quot;echo hello pydolphinscheduler&quot;</span>)\n    task_child_one = Shell(name=<span class=\"hljs-string\">&quot;task_child_one&quot;</span>, command=<span class=\"hljs-string\">&quot;echo &#x27;child one&#x27;&quot;</span>)\n    task_child_two = Shell(name=<span class=\"hljs-string\">&quot;task_child_two&quot;</span>, command=<span class=\"hljs-string\">&quot;echo &#x27;child two&#x27;&quot;</span>)\n    task_union = Shell(name=<span class=\"hljs-string\">&quot;task_union&quot;</span>, command=<span class=\"hljs-string\">&quot;echo union&quot;</span>)\n\n    <span class=\"hljs-comment\"># Define dependencies between tasks</span>\n    <span class=\"hljs-comment\"># Here, task_child_one and task_child_two are first declared as a task group through python&#x27;s list</span>\n    task_group = [task_child_one, task_child_two]\n    <span class=\"hljs-comment\"># Use the set_downstream method to declare the task group task_group as the downstream of task_parent, and declare the upstream through set_upstream</span>\n    task_parent.set_downstream(task_group)\n\n    <span class=\"hljs-comment\"># Use the bit operator &lt;&lt; to declare the task_union as the downstream of the task_group, and support declaration through the bit operator &gt;&gt;</span>\n    task_union &lt;&lt; task_group\n\n</code></pre>\n<p>When the above code runs, you can see workflow in the web UI as follows:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language---&gt;\">                / \\\ntask_parent --&gt; --&gt; task_union\n                \\ /\n                  --&gt; task_child_two\n</code></pre>\n<h3>2 Wecom alarm mode supports group chat message push</h3>\n<p>In the previous version, the WeChat alarm only supported the message notification; in version 2.0.2, when the user uses the Wecom alarm, it supports pushing the group chat message in the app to the user.</p>\n<h2>02 Optimization</h2>\n<h3>1 Simplified metadata initialization process</h3>\n<p>When Apache DolphinScheduler is first installed, running <a href=\"http://create-dolphinscheduler.sh\">create-dolphinscheduler.sh</a> requires a step  by step upgrade from the oldest version to the current version. In order to initialize the metadata process more conveniently and quickly, version 2.0.2 allows users to directly install the current version of the database script, which improves the installation speed.</p>\n<h3>2 Remove &quot;+1&quot; (days) in complement dates</h3>\n<p>Removed the &quot;+1&quot; day in the complement date to avoid user confusion when the UI date always displays +1 when the complement is added.</p>\n<h2>03 Bug Fixes</h2>\n<p>[#7661] fix logger memory leak in worker\n[#7750] Compatible with historical version data source connection information\n[#7705] Memory constraints cause errors when upgrading from 1.3.5 to 2.0.2\n[#7786] Service restart fails after a forced termination\n[#7660] Process definition version create time is wrong\n[#7607] Failed to execute PROCEDURE node\n[#7639] Add default configuration of quartz and zookeeper in common configuration items\n[#7654] In the dependency node, an error is reported when there is an option that does not belong to the current project\n[#7658] Workflow replication error\n[#7609] Workflow is always running when worker sendResult succeeds but the master does not receive error report\n[#7554] H2 in Standalone Server will automatically restart after a few minutes, resulting in abnormal data loss\n[#7434] Error reported when executing MySQL table creation statement\n[#7537] Dependent node retry delay does not work\n[#7392] Failed to add a Hive data source</p>\n<p>Download: <a href=\"https://dolphinscheduler.apache.org/zh-cn/download/download.html\">https://dolphinscheduler.apache.org/zh-cn/download/download.html</a>\nRelease Note: <a href=\"https://github.com/apache/dolphinscheduler/releases/tag/2.0.2\">https://github.com/apache/dolphinscheduler/releases/tag/2.0.2</a></p>\n<h2>04 Thanks</h2>\n<p>As always, we would like to thank all the contributors (in no particular order) who have worked to polish Apache DolphinScheduler 2.0.2 as a better platform.
