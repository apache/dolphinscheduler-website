The types of files that can be created include: txt, log, sh, conf, py, java and so on. Files can be edited, renamed, downloaded and deleted.</p>\n<p><img src=\"/img/new_ui/dev/resource/file-manage.png\" alt=\"file-manage\"></p>\n<h2>Basic Operator</h2>\n<h3>Create a File</h3>\n<p>The file format supports the following types: txt, log, sh, conf, cfg, py, java, sql, xml, hql, properties.</p>\n<p><img src=\"/img/new_ui/dev/resource/create-file.png\" alt=\"create-file\"></p>\n<h3>Upload Files</h3>\n<p>Click the &quot;Upload File&quot; button to upload, drag the file to the upload area, the file name will be automatically completed with the uploaded file name.</p>\n<p><img src=\"/img/new_ui/dev/resource/upload-file.png\" alt=\"upload-file\"></p>\n<h3>View File Content</h3>\n<p>For the files that can be viewed, click the file name to view the file details.</p>\n<p><img src=\"/img/tasks/demo/file_detail.png\" alt=\"file_detail\"></p>\n<h3>Download file</h3>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Click the &quot;Download&quot; button in the file list to download the file or click the &quot;Download&quot; button in the upper right corner of the file details to download the file.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h3>Rename File</h3>\n<p><img src=\"/img/new_ui/dev/resource/rename-file.png\" alt=\"rename-file\"></p>\n<h3>Delete File</h3>\n<p>File list -&gt; Click the &quot;Delete&quot; button to delete the specified file.</p>\n<h3>Re-upload file</h3>\n<p>Click the &quot;Re-upload File&quot; button to upload a new file to replace the old file, drag the file to the re-upload area, the file name will be automatically completed with the new uploaded file name.</p>\n<p><img src=\"/img/reupload_file_en.png\" alt=\"reuplod_file\"></p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Note: File name or source name of your local file can not contain specific characters like <code>.</code> or <code>/</code> when you trying to\nupload, create or rename file in resource center.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h2>Example</h2>\n<p>The example uses a simple shell script to demonstrate the use of resource center files in workflow definitions. The same is true for tasks such as MR and Spark, which require jar packages.</p>\n<h3>Create a shell file</h3>\n<p>Create a shell file, print <code>hello world</code>.</p>\n<p><img src=\"/img/new_ui/dev/resource/demo/file-demo01.png\" alt=\"create-shell\"></p>\n<p>Create the workflow execution shell</p>\n<p>In the workflow definition module of project Manage, create a new workflow using a shell task.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Script: 'sh <a href=\"http://hello.sh\">hello.sh</a>'</li>\n<li>Resource: Select '<a href=\"http://hello.sh\">hello.sh</a>'</li>\n</ul>\n<p><img src=\"/img/new_ui/dev/resource/demo/file-demo02.png\" alt=\"use-shell\"></p>\n<h3>View the results</h3>\n<p>You can view the log results of running the node in the workflow example.
