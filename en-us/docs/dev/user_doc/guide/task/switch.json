If <code>Default</code> is selected, randomly select a worker machine for execution.</li>\n<li>Times of failed retry attempts: The number of times the task failed to resubmit. You can select from drop-down or fill-in a number.</li>\n<li>Failed retry interval: The time interval for resubmitting the task after a failed task. You can select from drop-down or fill-in a number.</li>\n<li>Timeout alarm: Check the timeout alarm and timeout failure. When the task runs exceed the &quot;timeout&quot;, an alarm email will send and the task execution will fail.</li>\n<li>Condition: You can configure multiple conditions for the switch task. When the conditions are satisfied, execute the configured branch. You can configure multiple different conditions to satisfy different businesses.</li>\n<li>Branch flow: The default branch flow, when all the conditions are not satisfied, execute this branch flow.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Detail</h2>\n<p>Here we have three tasks, the dependencies are <code>A -&gt; B -&gt; [C, D]</code>, and <code>task_a</code> is a shell task and <code>task_b</code> is a switch task</p>\n<ul>\n<li>In task A, a global variable named <code>id</code> is defined through <a href=\"../parameter/global.md\">global variable</a>, and the declaration method is <code>${setValue(id=1)}</code></li>\n<li>Task B adds conditions and uses global variables declared upstream to achieve conditional judgment (Note: switch can get the global variables value, as long as its direct or indirect upstream have already assigned the global variables before switch acquires). We want to execute task C when <code>id = 1</code>, otherwise run task D\n<ul>\n<li>Configure task C to run when the global variable <code>id=1</code>. Then edit <code>${id} == 1</code> in the condition of task B, and select <code>C</code> as branch flow</li>\n<li>For other tasks, select <code>D</code> as branch flow</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The following shows the switch task configuration:</p>\n<p><img src=\"../../../../../../img/switch_configure.jpg\" alt=\"task-switch-configure\"></p>\n<h2>Related Task</h2>\n<p><a href=\"conditions.md\">condition</a>：<a href=\"conditions.md\">Condition</a>task mainly executes the corresponding branch based on the execution result status (success, failure) of the upstream node.\nThe <a href=\"switch.md\">Switch</a> task mainly executes the corresponding branch based on the value of the <a href=\"../parameter/global.md\">global parameter</a> and the judgment expression result written by the user.</p>\n",
