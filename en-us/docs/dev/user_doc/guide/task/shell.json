When the worker run the shell task, a temporary shell script is generated, and use the Linux user with the same name as the tenant executes the script.</p>\n<h2>Create Task</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Click <code>Project -&gt; Management-Project -&gt; Name-Workflow Definition</code>, and click the <code>Create Workflow</code> button to enter the DAG editing page.</li>\n<li>Drag  from the toolbar <img src=\"/img/tasks/icons/shell.png\" width=\"15\"/> to the canvas.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Task Parameter</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Node name: The node name in a workflow definition is unique.</li>\n<li>Run flag: Identifies whether this node schedules normally, if it does not need to execute, select the <code>prohibition execution</code>.</li>\n<li>Descriptive information: Describe the function of the node.</li>\n<li>Task priority: When the number of worker threads is insufficient, execute in the order of priority from high to low, and tasks with the same priority will execute in a first-in first-out order.</li>\n<li>Worker grouping: Assign tasks to the machines of the worker group to execute. If <code>Default</code> is selected, randomly select a worker machine for execution.</li>\n<li>Environment Name: Configure the environment name in which run the script.</li>\n<li>Times of failed retry attempts: The number of times the task failed to resubmit. You can select from drop-down or fill-in a number.</li>\n<li>Failed retry interval: The time interval for resubmitting the task after a failed task. You can select from drop-down or fill-in a number.</li>\n<li>Timeout alarm: Check the timeout alarm and timeout failure. When the task runs exceed the &quot;timeout&quot;, an alarm email will send and the task execution will fail.</li>\n<li>Script: Shell program developed by users.</li>\n<li>Resource: Refers to the list of resource files that called in the script, and upload or create files by the Resource Center file management.</li>\n<li>Custom parameters: It is a user-defined local parameter of Shell, and will replace the content with <code>${variable}</code> in the script.</li>\n<li>Predecessor task: Selecting a predecessor task for the current task, will set the selected predecessor task as upstream of the current task.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Task Example</h2>\n<h3>Simply Print</h3>\n<p>We make an example simulate from a common task which runs by one command. The example is to print one line in the log file, as shown in the following figure:\n&quot;This is a demo of shell task&quot;.</p>\n<p><img src=\"/img/tasks/demo/shell.jpg\" alt=\"demo-shell-simple\"></p>\n<h3>Custom Parameters</h3>\n<p>This example simulates a custom parameter task. We use parameters for reusing existing tasks as template or coping with the dynamic task. In this case,\nwe declare a custom parameter named &quot;param_key&quot;, with the value &quot;param_val&quot;. Then we use <code>echo</code> to print the parameter &quot;${param_key}&quot; we just declared.\nAfter running this example, we would see &quot;param_val&quot; print in the log.</p>\n<p><img src=\"/img/tasks/demo/shell_custom_param.jpg\" alt=\"demo-shell-custom-param\"></p>\n",
