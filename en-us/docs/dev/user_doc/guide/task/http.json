If Default is selected, a worker machine will be randomly selected for execution.</li>\n<li><strong>Environment Name</strong>: Configure the environment name in which to run the script.</li>\n<li><strong>Number of failed retry attempts</strong>: The number of times the task failed to be resubmitted.</li>\n<li><strong>Failed retry interval</strong>: The time, in cents, interval for resubmitting the task after a failed task.</li>\n<li><strong>Delayed execution time</strong>: the time, in cents, that a task is delayed in execution.</li>\n<li><strong>Timeout alarm</strong>: Check the timeout alarm and timeout failure. When the task exceeds the &quot;timeout period&quot;, an alarm email will be sent and the task execution will fail.</li>\n<li><strong>Request address</strong>: HTTP request URL.</li>\n<li><strong>Request type</strong>: Support GET, POSt, HEAD, PUT, DELETE.</li>\n<li><strong>Request parameters</strong>: Support Parameter, Body, Headers.</li>\n<li><strong>Verification conditions</strong>: support default response code, custom response code, content included, content not included.</li>\n<li><strong>Verification content</strong>: When the verification condition selects a custom response code, the content contains, and the content does not contain, the verification content is required.</li>\n<li><strong>Custom parameter</strong>: It is a user-defined parameter of http part, which will replace the content with <code>${variable}</code> in the script.</li>\n<li><strong>Predecessor task</strong>: Selecting a predecessor task for the current task will set the selected predecessor task as upstream of the current task.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Example</h2>\n<p>HTTP defines the different methods of interacting with the server, the most basic methods are GET, POST, PUT and DELETE. Here we use the http task node to demonstrate the use of POST to send a request to the system's login page to submit data.</p>\n<p>The main configuration parameters are as follows:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>URL: Address to access the target resource. Here is the system's login page.</li>\n<li>HTTP Parameters:\n<ul>\n<li>userName: Username</li>\n<li>userPassword: User login password</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p><img src=\"/img/tasks/demo/http_task01.png\" alt=\"http_task\"></p>\n<h2>Notice</h2>\n<p>None</p>\n",
