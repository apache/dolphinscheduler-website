For a stand-alone\nenvironment, you can select the local file directory as the upload folder (<strong>this operation does not require Hadoop or HDFS deployment</strong>).\nOf course, you can also choose to upload to Hadoop or MinIO cluster. In this case, you need to have Hadoop (2.6+) or MinIOn and other related environments.</p>\n",
