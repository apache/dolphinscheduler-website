And set yourself a &quot;deadline&quot; when to Submit the Feature, and add it in the reply comment.</li>\n<li>It's a good idea to find a mentor (or an instructor) in the core contributors who gives immediate feedback on design and functional implementation.</li>\n<li>You should create a new branch to start your work, to get the name of the branch refer to the <a href=\"./pull-request.md\">Submit Guide-Pull Request Notice</a>. For example, if you want to complete the feature and submit Issue 111, your branch name should be feature-111. The feature name can be determined after discussion with the instructor.</li>\n<li>When you're done, send a Pull Request to dolphinscheduler, please refer to the《<a href=\"./submit-code.md\">Submit Guide-Submit Pull Request Process</a>》</li>\n</ul>\n<p>If you want to submit a Pull Request to complete a Feature or fix a Bug, it is recommended that you start with the <code>good first issue</code>, <code>easy-to-fix</code> issues, complete a small function to submit, do not change too many files at a time, changing too many files will also put a lot of pressure on Reviewers, it is recommended to submit them through multiple Pull Requests, not all at once.</p>\n",
