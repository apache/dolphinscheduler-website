All rows of the corresponding column are converted to <code>List&lt;String&gt;</code> as the value of this parameter. If there is no match, it is discarded.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>SHELL node</h3>\n<p>The result of the processor execution is returned as <code>Map&lt;String,String&gt;</code>.</p>\n<p>The user needs to define <code>${setValue(key=value)}</code> in the output when defining the shell script.</p>\n<p>Remove <code>${setValue()}</code> when processing parameters, split by &quot;=&quot;, with the 0th being the key and the 1st being the value.</p>\n<p>Similarly match the OUT parameter name and key defined by the user when defining the task, and use value as the value of that parameter.</p>\n<p>Return parameter processing</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The result of acquired Processor is String.</li>\n<li>Determine whether the processor is empty or not, and exit if it is empty.</li>\n<li>Determine whether the localParam is empty or not, and exit if it is empty.</li>\n<li>Get the parameter of localParam which is OUT, and exit if it is empty.</li>\n<li>Format String as per appeal format (<code>List&lt;Map&lt;String,String&gt;&gt;</code> for SQL, <code>Map&lt;String,String&gt;&gt;</code> for shell).</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Assign the parameters with matching values to varPool (List, which contains the original IN's parameters)</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Format the varPool as json and pass it to master.</li>\n<li>The parameters that are OUT would be written into the localParam after the master has received the varPool.</li>\n</ul>\n",
