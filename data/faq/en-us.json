So after I delete the hostname matched with 127.0.0.1, and only remain internal ip resolution, instead of remove all the 127.0.0.1 resolution record. As long as hostname cmd return the correct internal ip configured in /etc/hosts can fix this bug. DolphinScheduler use the first record returned by hostname -i command. In my opinion, DS should not use hostname -i to get the ip , as in many companies the devops configured the server name, we suggest use ip configured in configuration file or znode instead of /etc/hosts.</p>\n<hr>\n"

    "a": "\n<p>A: For the task identified as <code>Cache Execution</code>, when the task starts, a cache key will be generated, and the key is composed of the following fields and hashed:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>task definition: the id of the task definition corresponding to the task instance</li>\n<li>task version: the version of the task definition corresponding to the task instance</li>\n<li>task input parameters: including the parameters passed in by the upstream node and the global parameter, the parameters referenced by the parameter list of the task definition and the parameters used by the task definition using <code>${}</code></li>\n<li>environment configuration: the actual configuration content of the environment configuration under the environment name, that is, the actual configuration content in the <code>security</code> - <code>environment management</code></li>\n</ul>\n<p>If the task with cache identification runs, it will find whether there is data with the same cache key in the database,</p>\n<ul>\n<li>If there is, copy the task instance and update the corresponding data</li>\n<li>If not, the task runs as usual, and the task instance data is stored in the cache when the task is completed</li>\n</ul>\n<p>If you do not need to cache, you can right-click the node to run <code>Clear cache</code> in the workflow instance to clear the cache, which will clear the cache data of the current input parameters under this version.</p>\n<p>We will collect more FAQ later</p>\n"
