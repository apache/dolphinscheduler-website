## New Features


**[Feature#6480] Add StandaloneServer to make development and operation easier**

StandaloneServer is a service created to allow users to quickly experience the product. The registry and database H2-DataBase and Zk-TestServer are built-in. Users can start StandaloneServer for debugging with only one line of command.

The way to start StandaloneServer with one-line command: switch to a user with sudo permission, and run the script

```plain
sh ./bin/dolphinscheduler-daemon.sh start standalone-server
```

It shows that 1.3.9 reduces the configuration cost through built-in components. You only need to configure the jdk environment to start the DolphinScheduler system with one click, thereby improving the efficiency of research and development. For detailed usage documents, please refer to: link to be added.

## Optimization and Fix

**☆[Fix #6337][Task] Sql limit param no default value**

When the SqlTask ​​is executed, if the limit parameter is not set, the displayed result is empty. Based on this, the default parameters have been added in 1.3.9, and relevant instructions have been made on the log to allow users to track the problem more clearly.

**☆[Bug#6429] [ui] sub_process node open sub_task show empty page #6429**

The problem that the sub_task node is displayed as empty has been fixed.

## Contributor

Thanks to PMC Ke Zhenxu from the SkyWalking community for his contribution to StandaloneServer, Apache DolphinScheduler will persistently optimize the function design and enhance the user experience with the participation of more contributors, so stay tuned.
