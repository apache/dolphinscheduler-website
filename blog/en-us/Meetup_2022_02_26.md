Hello the community! After having adjusted ourselves from the pleasure of Spring Festival and re-devote to the busywork, study, and life, Apache DolphinScheduler is here to wish everyone a prosperous and successful journey in the Lunar year of the Tiger.

In this early spring, Apache DolphinScheduler's first Meetup in 2022 is also coming soon. I believe that the community has already been looking forward to it!

In this Meetup, four guests from our user companies will share their experience when using Apache DolphinScheduler. Whether you are a user of Apache DolphinScheduler or a spectator, you can definitely learn a lot from it.

We are looking forward to more friends joining us in the future, and more and more users will share practical experiences with each other. 

The first show of Apache DolphinScheduler in February 2022 will be broadcast on time at 14:00 pm on February 26th.
