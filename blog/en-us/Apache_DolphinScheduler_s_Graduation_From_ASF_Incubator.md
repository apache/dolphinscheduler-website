Before you know it, Apache DolphinScheduler has graduated from the Apache Software Foundation (ASF) incubator for one year!

On April 9, 2021(Beijing Time), the ASF announced that Apache DolphinScheduler had graduated as a top project, bringing the first Chinese-led project in big data workflow scheduling to the world.

Now, one year on, Apache DolphinScheduler has picked up the pace with the attention and help of ASF and is aiming to play a more important role in the DataOps space.

As we mark the first anniversary of Apache DolphinScheduler's graduation from the ASF incubator, we'd like to report on what the project has achieved in this limited time with the help of the ASF and the community.

## Keeping rapid iteration and good health

According to ASF Project Statistics, the Apache DolphinScheduler community has a health score of 9.19, which means the community is in good running.

Currently, there are 45 Committers and 19 PMCs in the community, with a Committer-to-PMC ratio of 2:1.

Since its inception, Apache DolphinScheduler has undergone several iterations of feature refinement and performance improvement and has been continuously optimized to fit developers' habits, providing users with a mature workflow scheduling solution that has been tested in production environments.

At present, Apache DolphinScheduler has also started to internationalize, for example trying to add Python, AWS, and time zone support to align with international development and usage.

## Witness the speed up of open-source  in China

2021 is a year of growth for Apache DolphinScheduler, and a year of rapid growth for Chinese open-source projects, too.

* Over 20% of CNCF's open-source projects come from China, making the second-largest contribution in the world.
* In 2021, for the first time,  Chinese(Sheng Wu) was elected to the Board of Directors of the Apache Software Foundation.
* In 2021, five projects from China (Apache Linkis, Apache Kyuubi, Apache ShenYu, Apache Eventmesh, and Apache SeaTunnel, which are currently incubating) successfully entered the Apache Incubator. To date, there are 14 ASF projects from China.
* There is also one incubation project that has graduated to the top tier of Apache, which is Apache DolphinScheduler.

As we can see, there is huge potential in open source, and we are calling on more people who are interested in it to join hands with Apache DolphinScheduler so that we can grow together and push Chinese open source to a higher stage in the world!
