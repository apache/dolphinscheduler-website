PyDolphinScheduler
==================

**PyDolphinScheduler** is Python API for `Apache DolphinScheduler <https://dolphinscheduler.apache.org>`_,
which allow you definition your workflow by Python code, aka workflow-as-codes.

History
-------

We seperated PyDolphinScheduler code base from `Apache dolphinscheduler code base <https://github.com/apache/dolphinscheduler>`_
into independent repository at Nov 7, 2022. Now the code base is in `Apache dolphinscheduler-sdk-python <https://github.com/apache/dolphinscheduler-sdk-python>`_
and all issue and pull requests should be submitted to this repository.

The reason why we seperated is for the following reasons:

- **Clear responsibility**: The code base of PyDolphinScheduler is independent of DolphinScheduler, it has its
  own users and developers, CI and test cases, even the language is different.
- **Independent release cycle**: PyDolphinScheduler is a SDK, it should be released independently of DolphinScheduler.
  before we seperated, we have to release PyDolphinScheduler every time when DolphinScheduler. This brings two
  main problems:

  - DolphinScheduler release cycle is a little long for PyDolphinScheduler, because PyDolphinScheduler is a new subproject
    for DolphinScheduler, it is not stable enough, we have many features and enhancement want to add, so we have to release
    DolphinScheduler more frequently.
  - We have to release PyDolphinScheduler every time when DolphinScheduler, even if there is no change in PyDolphinScheduler.
    In the past, we release both of them at the same time, and some of DolphinScheduler bugfix version like 2.0.5, 2.0.6, 2.0.7
    only fix some bugs in DolphinScheduler, but not in PyDolphinScheduler, is it unnecessary to release PyDolphinScheduler
    but we have to because the rule is we release them both at the same time.
  - Should use the same version as DolphinScheduler do, due to the same release cycle, we have to have the same version
    as DolphinScheduler, so you may see there are some functional adder in DolphinScheduler bugfix version, it may
    be a little strange to PyDolphinScheduler users.

- **Faster CI Run**: PyDolphinScheduler has its own CI, it is not necessary to run DolphinScheduler CI when we only
  change PyDolphinScheduler code. And DolphinScheduler CI is more complete, and some of CI is required to merge pull requests,
  Separating PyDolphinScheduler from DolphinScheduler can make CI run faster in both two repositories.

Version
-------

At Nov 7, 2022 we seperated PyDolphinScheduler. And before that, PyDolphinScheduler have the same version with DolphinScheduler.
So the version of PyDolphinScheduler is the same as DolphinScheduler, for example PyDolphinScheduler 2.0.5 is matched with
DolphinScheduler 2.0.5. For more details about why we seperated PyDolphinScheduler, please refer to `History`_.

And after we seperated, we will release PyDolphinScheduler independently, and the version of PyDolphinScheduler will
be different with DolphinScheduler, and some of PyDolphinScheduler version will not match multiple DolphinScheduler version
because the code do not change in PyDolphinScheduler, and we will release PyDolphinScheduler but support multiple DolphinScheduler
version due to we do not change
`PythonGateway <https://github.com/apache/dolphinscheduler/blob/dev/dolphinscheduler-api/src/main/java/org/apache/dolphinscheduler/api/python/PythonGateway.java>`_
code.

We will release PyDolphinScheduler version **4.0.0** as the first version after we seperated, so please be ware of when you
use PyDolphinScheduler above version 4.0.0.
