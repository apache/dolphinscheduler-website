Node names within a workflow definition are unique.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Run flag</td>\n<td>Indicates whether the node can be scheduled normally. If it is not necessary to execute, you can turn on the prohibiting execution switch.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Description</td>\n<td>Describes the function of this node.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Task priority</td>\n<td>When the number of worker threads is insufficient, they are executed in order from high to low according to the priority, and they are executed according to the first-in, first-out principle when the priority is the same.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Worker group</td>\n<td>The task is assigned to the machines in the worker group for execution.
