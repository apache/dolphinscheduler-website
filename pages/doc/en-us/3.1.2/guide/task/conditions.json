  "__html": "<h1 id=\"conditions\">Conditions</h1>\n<p>Condition is a conditional node, that determines which downstream task should run based on the condition of the upstream task. Currently, the Conditions support multiple upstream tasks, but only two downstream tasks. When the number of upstream tasks exceeds one, achieve complex upstream dependencies by through <code>and</code> and <code>or</code> operators.</p>\n<h2 id=\"create-task\">Create Task</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Click <code>Project Management -&gt; Project Name -&gt; Workflow Definition</code>, and click the <code>Create Workflow</code> button to enter the DAG editing page.</li>\n<li>Drag from the toolbar <img src=\"/img/conditions.png\" width=\"20\"/> task node to canvas.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"task-parameters\">Task Parameters</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Please refer to <a href=\"/en-us/docs/3.1.2/guide/task/appendix\">DolphinScheduler Task Parameters Appendix</a> <code>Default Task Parameters</code> section for default parameters.</li>\n</ul>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th><strong>Parameter</strong></th>\n<th><strong>Description</strong></th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>Downstream tasks selection</td>\n<td>Depending on the status of the predecessor task, you can jump to the corresponding branch, currently two branches are supported: success, failure <ul><li>Success: When the upstream task runs successfully, run the success branch.</li><li>Failure: When the upstream task runs failed, run the failure branch.</li></ul></li></ul></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Upstream condition selection</td>\n<td>Can select one or more upstream tasks for conditions.<ul><li>Add an upstream dependency: the first parameter is to choose a specified task name, and the second parameter is to choose the upstream task status to trigger conditions.</li><li>Select upstream task relationship: use <code>and</code> and <code>or</code> operators to handle the complex relationship of upstream when there are multiple upstream tasks for conditions.</li></ul></li></ul></td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<h2 id=\"related-task\">Related Task</h2>\n<p><a href=\"/en-us/docs/3.1.2/guide/task/switch\">switch</a>: Conditions task mainly executes the corresponding branch based on the execution status (success, failure) of the upstream nodes.
