Before creating a temporary table, we need to ensure that the table does not exist. So we use custom parameters to obtain the time of the day as the suffix of the table name every time we run, this task can run every different day. The format of the created table name is: <code>tmp_hello_world_{yyyyMMdd}</code>.\n<strong>Note</strong>ï¼šthe hive datasource in the SQL task based on JDBC to execute SQLs, SQL statement does not support multi-statements, please avoid using ';' at the end of the statement. To process multi-statements please use <a href=\"/en-us/docs/3.1.9/guide/task/hive-cli\">Hive-Cli</a> task.</p>\n<p><img src=\"/img/tasks/demo/hive-sql.png\" alt=\"hive-sql\"></p>\n<h4 id=\"after-running-the-task-successfully,-query-the-results-in-hive\">After Running the Task Successfully, Query the Results in Hive</h4>\n<p>Log in to the bigdata cluster and use 'hive' command or 'beeline' or 'JDBC' and other methods to connect to the 'Apache Hive' for the query.
