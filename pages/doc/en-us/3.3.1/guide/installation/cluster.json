  "__html": "<h1 id=\"cluster-deployment\">Cluster Deployment</h1>\n<p>Cluster deployment is to deploy the DolphinScheduler on multiple machines for running massive tasks in production.</p>\n<p>If you are a new hand and want to experience DolphinScheduler functions, we recommend you install follow <a href=\"/en-us/docs/3.3.1/guide/installation/standalone\">Standalone deployment</a>. If you want to experience more complete functions and schedule massive tasks, we recommend you install follow <a href=\"/en-us/docs/3.3.1/guide/installation/pseudo-cluster\">pseudo-cluster deployment</a>. If you want to deploy DolphinScheduler in production, we recommend you follow <a href=\"/en-us/docs/3.3.1/guide/installation/cluster\">cluster deployment</a> or <a href=\"/en-us/docs/3.3.1/guide/installation/kubernetes\">Kubernetes deployment</a>.</p>\n<h2 id=\"deployment-steps\">Deployment Steps</h2>\n<p>Cluster deployment uses the same scripts and configuration files as <a href=\"/en-us/docs/3.3.1/guide/installation/pseudo-cluster\">pseudo-cluster deployment</a>, so the preparation and deployment steps are the same as pseudo-cluster deployment. The difference is that pseudo-cluster deployment is for one machine, while cluster deployment (Cluster) is for multiple machines. And steps of &quot;Modify Configuration&quot; are quite different between pseudo-cluster deployment and cluster deployment.</p>\n<h3 id=\"prerequisites-and-dolphinscheduler-startup-environment-preparations\">Prerequisites and DolphinScheduler Startup Environment Preparations</h3>\n<p>Distribute the installation package to each server of each cluster and perform all the steps in <a href=\"/en-us/docs/3.3.1/guide/installation/pseudo-cluster\">pseudo-cluster deployment</a> on each machine.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong><em>NOTICE:</em></strong> Make sure that the configuration files on each machine are consistent, otherwise the cluster will not work properly.\n<strong><em>NOTICE:</em></strong> Each service is stateless and independent of each other, so you can deploy multiple services on each machine, but you need to pay attention to port conflicts.\n<strong><em>NOTICE:</em></strong> DS uses the /tmp/dolphinscheduler directory as the resource center by default. If you need to change the directory of the resource center, change the resource items in the conf/common.properties file</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h3 id=\"modify-configuration\">Modify Configuration</h3>\n<p>This step differs quite a lot from <a href=\"/en-us/docs/3.3.1/guide/installation/pseudo-cluster\">pseudo-cluster deployment</a>, please use <code>scp</code> or other methods to distribute the configuration files to each machine, then modify the configuration files.</p>\n<h2 id=\"start-and-login-dolphinscheduler\">Start and Login DolphinScheduler</h2>\n<p>Same as <a href=\"/en-us/docs/3.3.1/guide/installation/pseudo-cluster\">pseudo-cluster</a></p>\n<h2 id=\"start-and-stop-server\">Start and Stop Server</h2>\n<p>Same as <a href=\"/en-us/docs/3.3.1/guide/installation/pseudo-cluster\">pseudo-cluster</a></p>\n",
