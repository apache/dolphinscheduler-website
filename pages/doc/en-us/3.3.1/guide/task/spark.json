See <a href=\"https://archive.apache.org/dist/spark/docs/3.2.1/#running-the-examples-and-shell\">spark-submit</a> for more details.</p>\n<p>(2) <code>spark sql</code> method to submit tasks.

The main purpose is to count the number of identical words in the input text. (Flink's releases attach this example job)</p>\n<h5 id=\"configure-the-spark-environment-in-dolphinscheduler\">Configure the Spark Environment in DolphinScheduler</h5>\n<p>If you are using the Spark task type in a production environment, it is necessary to configure the required environment first.

Insert the data of the view table terms into the table wc in parquet format.</p>\n<p><img src=\"/img/tasks/demo/spark_sql.png\" alt=\"spark_sql\"></p>\n<h2 id=\"note\">Note</h2>\n<p>JAVA and Scala are only used for identification, and there is no difference when you use the Spark task. If your application is developed by Python, you could just ignore the parameter <strong>Main Class</strong> in the form. Parameter <strong>SQL scripts</strong> is only for SQL type and could be ignored in JAVA, Scala and Python.</p>\n<p>SQL does not currently support cluster mode.</p>\n",
