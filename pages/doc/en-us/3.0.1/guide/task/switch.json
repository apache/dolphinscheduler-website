Node names within a workflow definition are unique.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Run flag</td>\n<td>Indicates whether the node can be scheduled normally. If it is not necessary to execute, you can turn on the prohibiting execution switch.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Description</td>\n<td>Describes the function of this node.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Task priority</td>\n<td>When the number of worker threads is insufficient, they are executed in order from high to low according to the priority, and they are executed according to the first-in, first-out principle when the priority is the same.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Worker group</td>\n<td>The task is assigned to the machines in the worker group for execution. If Default is selected, a worker machine will be randomly selected for execution.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Task group name</td>\n<td>The group in Resources, if not configured, it will not be used.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Environment Name</td>\n<td>Configure the environment in which to run the script.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Number of failed retries</td>\n<td>The number of times the task is resubmitted after failure. It supports drop-down and manual filling.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Failure Retry Interval</td>\n<td>The time interval for resubmitting the task if the task fails. It supports drop-down and manual filling.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Timeout alarm</td>\n<td>Check Timeout Alarm and Timeout Failure. When the task exceeds the &quot;timeout duration&quot;, an alarm email will be sent and the task execution will fail.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Delay execution time</td>\n<td>Task delay execution time.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Condition</td>\n<td>You can configure multiple conditions for the switch task. When the conditions are satisfied, execute the configured branch. You can configure multiple different conditions to satisfy different businesses.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Branch flow</td>\n<td>The default branch flow, when all the conditions are not satisfied, execute this branch flow.</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<h2 id=\"task-example\">Task Example</h2>\n<p>This is demonstrated using one switch task and three shell tasks.</p>\n<h3 id=\"create-a-workflow\">Create a workflow</h3>\n<p>Create a new switch task, and three shell tasks downstream.
