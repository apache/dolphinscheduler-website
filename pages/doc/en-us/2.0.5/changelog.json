When users need to modify the execution script, they do not need to reconfigure the task parameters to realize the function of automatically updating the execution script.\n[#8169] After the modification workflow is optimized, the page remains in the DAG page and will not jump to the list page.\n[#8285] In the dingtalk alarm plugin, add the markdown information type in the alarm content.</p>\n<h2 id=\"bug-fixes\">Bug Fixes</h2>\n<p>[#8213] Fixed the task runs incorrectly when the worker group contains uppercase letters.\n[#8347] Fixed the workflow cannot be stopped when the task fails and retries\n[#8135] Fixed JDBC connection parameter not input '@'\n[#8367] Fixed complement may not end normally\n[#8170] Fix the sub workflow that cannot be entered from the page</p>\n",
