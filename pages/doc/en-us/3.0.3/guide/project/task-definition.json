  "__html": "<h1 id=\"task-definition\">Task Definition</h1>\n<p>Task definition allows to modify or operate tasks at the task level rather than modifying them in the workflow definition.\nWe already have workflow level task editor in <a href=\"/en-us/docs/3.0.3/guide/project/workflow-definition\">workflow definition</a> which you can click the specific\nworkflow and then edit its task definition. It is depressing when you want to edit the task definition but do not remember\nwhich workflow it belongs to. So we decide to add <code>Task Definition</code> view under <code>Task</code> menu.</p>\n<p><img src=\"/img/new_ui/dev/project/task-definition.jpg\" alt=\"task-definition\"></p>\n<p>In this view, you can create, query, update, delete task definition by click the related button in <code>operation</code> column. The\nmost exciting thing is you could query task by task name in the wildcard, and it is useful when you only remember the task\nname but forget which workflow it belongs to. It is also supported query by the task name alone with <code>Task Type</code> or\n<code>Workflow Name</code></p>\n",
