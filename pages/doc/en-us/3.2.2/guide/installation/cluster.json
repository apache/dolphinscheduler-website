If you want to experience more complete functions and schedule massive tasks, we recommend you install follow <a href=\"/en-us/docs/3.2.2/guide/installation/pseudo-cluster\">pseudo-cluster deployment</a>. If you want to deploy DolphinScheduler in production, we recommend you follow <a href=\"/en-us/docs/3.2.2/guide/installation/cluster\">cluster deployment</a> or <a href=\"/en-us/docs/3.2.2/guide/installation/kubernetes\">Kubernetes deployment</a>.</p>\n<h2 id=\"deployment-steps\">Deployment Steps</h2>\n<p>Cluster deployment uses the same scripts and configuration files as <a href=\"/en-us/docs/3.2.2/guide/installation/pseudo-cluster\">pseudo-cluster deployment</a>, so the preparation and deployment steps are the same as pseudo-cluster deployment. The difference is that pseudo-cluster deployment is for one machine, while cluster deployment (Cluster) is for multiple machines. And steps of &quot;Modify Configuration&quot; are quite different between pseudo-cluster deployment and cluster deployment.</p>\n<h3 id=\"prerequisites-and-dolphinscheduler-startup-environment-preparations\">Prerequisites and DolphinScheduler Startup Environment Preparations</h3>\n<p>Configure all the configurations refer to <a href=\"/en-us/docs/3.2.2/guide/installation/pseudo-cluster\">pseudo-cluster deployment</a> on every machine, except sections <code>Prerequisites</code>, <code>Start ZooKeeper</code> and <code>Initialize the Database</code> of the <code>DolphinScheduler Startup Environment</code>.</p>\n<h3 id=\"modify-configuration\">Modify Configuration</h3>\n<p>This step differs quite a lot from <a href=\"/en-us/docs/3.2.2/guide/installation/pseudo-cluster\">pseudo-cluster deployment</a>, please use <code>scp</code> or other methods to distribute the configuration files to each machine, then modify the configuration files.</p>\n<h2 id=\"start-and-login-dolphinscheduler\">Start and Login DolphinScheduler</h2>\n<p>Same as <a href=\"/en-us/docs/3.2.2/guide/installation/pseudo-cluster\">pseudo-cluster</a></p>\n<h2 id=\"start-and-stop-server\">Start and Stop Server</h2>\n<p>Same as <a href=\"/en-us/docs/3.2.2/guide/installation/pseudo-cluster\">pseudo-cluster</a></p>\n",
