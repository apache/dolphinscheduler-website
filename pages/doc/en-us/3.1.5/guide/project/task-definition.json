It is depressing when you want to edit the task definition but do not remember\nwhich workflow it belongs to. So we decide to add <code>Task Definition</code> view under <code>Task</code> menu.</p>\n<p><img src=\"/img/new_ui/dev/project/batch-task-definition.png\" alt=\"task-definition\"></p>\n<p>In this view, you can create, query, update, delete task definition by click the related button in <code>operation</code> column. The\nmost exciting thing is you could query task by task name in the wildcard, and it is useful when you only remember the task\nname but forget which workflow it belongs to. It is also supported query by the task name alone with <code>Task Type</code> or\n<code>Workflow Name</code></p>\n<h2 id=\"stream-task-definition\">Stream Task Definition</h2>\n<p>Stream task definitions are created in the workflow definition, and can be modified and executed.</p>\n<p><img src=\"/img/new_ui/dev/project/stream-task-definition.png\" alt=\"task-definition\"></p>\n<p>Click the execute button, check the execution parameters and click Confirm to submit the stream task.</p>\n<p><img src=\"/img/new_ui/dev/project/stream-task-execute.png\" alt=\"task-definition\"></p>\n",
